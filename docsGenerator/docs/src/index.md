# Welcome

Welcome to AR.IO!

The AR.IO ecosystem is dedicated to cultivating products and protocols for sustaining access to digital permanence, making the permaweb available to everyone. Powered by the IO Token, our global network connects users to permanently stored data, files, applications, and web pages on the Arweave decentralized storage network.

# Arweave Name System (ArNS): Simplifying Permaweb Navigation

One of the exciting features within the AR.IO ecosystem is the Arweave Name System (ArNS). ArNS is a censorship-resistant naming system stored on Arweave, enabling user-friendly domain names that link to permaweb dApps, web pages, data, and identities. It functions like a permissionless address book for the entire permaweb. Each AR.IO gateway serves as an ArNS Name resolver, ensuring fast and efficient access.

Join us now and experience the full potential of the permaweb with AR.IO!
