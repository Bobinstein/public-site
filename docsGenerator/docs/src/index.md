# What is ar.io

ar.io is a global network, protocol, and currency that enables the permaweb. It is the decentralized and incentivized gateway node network of the Arweave ecosystem. Comprised of operators, developers, and end users, this network leverages a utility token to proliferate access to the permaweb: the files, applications, web pages and data permanently stored on the Arweave decentralized storage network. 

 

The various nodes on the ar.io Network, known as gateways, are the interface between users and the permaweb. Each gateway acts like a “Permaweb Service Provider” and supports multiple, value-added, services like reading, writing, querying, and indexing of Arweave data. 

 

The ar.io token, referred to as IO or ɸ, is a SmartWeave token used for protocol incentives, gateway accountability, and payments for services like the Arweave Name System (ArNS). It will enable gateways on the ar.io Network to operate under a low-trust model with the users of their service.
